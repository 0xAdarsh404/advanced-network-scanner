## üìã Requirements

```bash
Python 3.6+
No external dependencies required (uses only standard library)
```

## üîß Installation

1. Clone or download the scanner:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd advanced-network-scanner
```

2. Make the script executable (Linux/Mac):
```bash
chmod +x scanner.py
```

## üíª Usage

### Basic Usage
```bash
# Scan common ports on a target
python scanner.py 192.168.1.1

# Scan specific port range
python scanner.py example.com -p 1-1000

# Use custom thread count and timeout
python scanner.py 10.0.0.1 -p 1-5000 -t 200 --timeout 2

# Save results to JSON file
python scanner.py target.com -o scan_results.json
```

### Command Line Options
```
positional arguments:
  target                Target IP address or hostname

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            Show help message
  -p, --ports PORTS     Port range (e.g., 1-1000) or specific ports
  -t, --threads THREADS Number of threads (default: 100)
  --timeout TIMEOUT     Socket timeout in seconds (default: 1)
  -o, --output OUTPUT   Output file for JSON report
  -v, --verbose         Enable verbose output
```

## üìä Sample Output

```

## üîç Features Breakdown

### Service Detection
- Automatic service identification based on port numbers
- Banner grabbing for detailed service information
- Support for common protocols (HTTP, SSH, FTP, SMTP, etc.)

### Vulnerability Assessment
- Database of known vulnerable service versions
- Common security misconfigurations detection
- Severity classification (High, Medium, Low)

### Performance Optimization
- Multi-threaded scanning for speed
- Configurable thread pools and timeouts
- Efficient socket handling and resource management

### Reporting
- Real-time console output
- Comprehensive JSON reports
- Structured data for further analysis

## üîí Security Considerations

- **Ethical Use**: Only scan systems you own or have permission to test
- **Rate Limiting**: Adjust thread count to avoid overwhelming targets
- **Legal Compliance**: Ensure compliance with local laws and regulations
- **Responsible Disclosure**: Report vulnerabilities through proper channels

## üß™ Testing

Test the scanner on your own systems or dedicated testing environments:

```bash
# Test on localhost
python scanner.py 127.0.0.1 -p 1-1000

# Test with verbose output
python scanner.py localhost -p 20-25 -v
```

## üîß Customization

The scanner can be easily extended with additional features:

- **Custom Service Signatures**: Add new service detection patterns
- **Additional Vulnerability Checks**: Expand the vulnerability database
- **Output Formats**: Add XML, CSV, or other report formats
- **Advanced Scanning**: Implement UDP scanning, OS detection

## üìö Learning Outcomes

This project demonstrates:
- Network security fundamentals
- Python socket programming
- Concurrent programming techniques
- Security tool development
- Professional code documentation
